```R
# The corrected code uses parentheses to ensure that each condition
# is evaluated separately before the logical AND operation is applied.

df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

# Correct subsetting: Parentheses ensure correct logical indexing
correct_subset_df <- df[(df$x > 2) & (df$y < 9), ]
print(correct_subset_df)
